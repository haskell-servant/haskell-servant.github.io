# Introduction

Quite a lot of exciting changes have happened since the last major release.

# Upgrading

## *servant-server*

- Instead of `EitherT` (from `either`) we now use `ExceptT` (from `mtl`), which
  behaves the same, but doesn't add a dependency. Your handlers types have to
  change from e.g. `EitherT ServantErr IO MyType` to
  `ExceptT ServantErr IO MyType`. Throwing an error used to work with e.g.
  `left myError` and that now has to be switched to `throwE myError`. Both
  `ExceptT` and `throwE` reside in `Control.Monad.Trans.Except`.

- `Post` now returns 200. Replace with `PostCreated` if you want the old
behaviour (201).

- Methods returning `()` do not automatically return 204. Use `*NoContent` with
the `NoContent` type instead:

``` haskell
    -- Old code
    Get '[] ()
    -- New code
    GetNoContent '[JSON] NoContent
```

- `MatrixParam` has been removed.
- The content-type list now is invariably used to determine whether to respond
-- that is, you need to specify content-types even when returning `NoContent`.

## *servant-client*

- `client` now takes a `Manager` parameter.
- `MatrixParam` has been removed.

## *servant-docs*

- `ToSample` now only takes one type parameter.
- `MatrixParam` has been removed.

## If you have your own combinators

Then the story is more complicated. The `HasServer` class changed quite
drastically:

``` haskell
-- Previously
class HasServer layout config where
   type ServerT layout (m :: * -> *) :: *
   route :: Proxy layout -> Server layout -> RoutingApplication

-- Now
class HasServer layout config where
   type ServerT layout (m :: * -> *) :: *
   route :: Proxy layout -> Config config -> Delayed (Server layout) -> Router
```

# Major Changes

## Trie-based routing

Previously routing was *O(n)* in the number of routes, as we matched them
sequentially (and indeed, bodies would sometimes be deserialized more than
once). Andres improved this by transforming the routing into a trie.

## Proper error handling

One of the biggest embarassements for `servant` was the fact that in certain
circumstances, the HTTP error returned was not what one would expect. For
example, if a request had both the wrong method and the wrong body, the error
returned would be 400 (Bad Request) rather 405 (Method Not Allowed). This was
because we matched against parts of your API in the order they appeared in your
API type. Andres came up with an elegant solution to this problem, creating a
datatype that allows checks (and their side-effects) to be delayed.

This allows for a fine-grained control over when side-effects and general HTTP
logic is run. Currently there are five 'slots' for effects:

``` haskell
data Delayed c where
  Delayed :: { capturesD :: IO (RouteResult captures)
             , methodD   :: IO (RouteResult ())
             , authD     :: IO (RouteResult auth)
             , bodyD     :: IO (RouteResult body)
             , serverD   :: (captures -> auth -> body -> RouteResult c)
             } -> Delayed c
```
Which are run in the order in which they appear in the code. [Helper
functions](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/blob/master/servant-server/src/Servant/Server/Internal/RoutingApplication.hs#L140-L202)
can be used to add more effects. In practice, this means that if you are
writing a combinator for authentication, for example, you can simple use
`addAuthCheck` to schedule your action. It will only be run if the captures and
methods match, but before the body is run.

These five slots do not exhaust the steps of handling an HTTP request. But
rather than straight away implement a very large datatype for the entire [HTTP
decision
diagram](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e15cccf2a9277dcca2c8824092547dee7058744/68747470733a2f2f7261776769746875622e636f6d2f666f722d4745542f687474702d6465636973696f6e2d6469616772616d2f6d61737465722f6874747064642e706e67),
we decided to implement what was needed for the official `servant` combinators,
and ask the community if some use-case isn't satisfied by that. So if you feel
like another slot is needed, open an issue!

## `Context` machinery

We had an issue that kept annoying us. Consider what the `HasServer` instance
for a combinator that provides a `User` by looking up the cookie in a database.
The instance must be able to take a lookup function, or at least a connection
to the database. But these things must be passed in a run-time, and for fairly
involved reasons there was no good way of doing so.

We added a new parameter to `route` that is an `HList` with configuration data
(not unlike *Spock*'s `Context`). If you are not writing `HasServer` instances,
`Context` requires no changes to your code for upgrading. If you are, note that
the `HasServer` type class has an extra type parameter.

This change should enable a variety of new combinators that were difficult or
impossible previously. Note that `Context` is (for now at least) meant only for
the configuration of combinator instances, not for the configuration of
handlers (use `enter` for the later).


## `http-api-data`

The `FromText`/`ToText` have been renamed, revamped, and relocated. They are
now called `FromHttpApiData` and `ToHttpApiData` respectively, and exist in the
new package `http-api-data`. This was work by Nickolay Kudasov, and includes a
variety of other improvements. Most noticeably, rather than having a single
[de/]serialization method, there are now ones for each of the cases for which
we need the deserializaiton (this was based on an idea from Greg Weber):

``` haskell
class FromHttpApiData a where
    {-# MINIMAL parseUrlPiece | parseQueryParam #-}
    parseUrlPiece :: Text -> Either Text a
    parseUrlPiece = parseQueryParam

    parseHeader :: ByteString -> Either Text a
    parseHeader = parseUrlPiece . decodeUtf8

    parseQueryParam :: Text -> Either Text a
    parseQueryParam = parseUrlPiece
```

As an added bonus, the Template Haskell for `persistent` generates these
automatically, making using `persistent` with `servant` a lot easier.

The [haddocks](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-api-data-0.2.2/docs/Web-HttpApiData.html)
for the package have more information.

## Simplify `ToSample`

`ToSample` now takes only one parameter. It was an annoying mistake that it
ever took two, which Nickolay Kudasov fixed. Additionally, instead of having
two methods (`toSample` and `toSamples`) defined in terms of one another, we
now have a single one (`toSamples`).

``` haskell
data MyData = MyData Int

-- Old code
instance ToSample MyData MyData where
    toSample _ = singleSample (MyData 42)

instance ToSample MyData where
    toSamples _ = singleSample (MyData 42)
```

Nickolay also made a `Generic` default method for this class, so that now you
could simply have:

``` haskell
data MyData = MyData Int deriving (Generic, ToSample)
```

## Unifying method combinators

Previously each of 'Get', 'Put', 'Post', etc. were entirely separate datatypes.
This also meant each interpretation needed to included instances for all of
them. The 0.5 release makes them instead type-synonyms:

``` haskell
type Get contentTypes a = Verb 'GET 200 contentTypes a
```

This makes it easy to change the status code of a success response. To further
facilitate that, we now provide a variety of other type synonyms for responses
other than 200.

## Non-memoized request body

Prior to Andres LÃ¶h's trie-based routing improvements, we had to keep the
request body in memory for more-or-less the duration of the request-response
cycle. This was of course far from ideal, but necessary given that we could not
tell whether the request might be re-routed to a different endpoint. After the
changes, we can now remove it. Note however that certain idioms, such as

``` haskell
type API = ReqBody '[JSON] Int :> Get '[JSON] Int
      :<|> ReqBody '[JSON] String :> Get '[JSON] String
```

No longer make sense - a request body that cannot be decoded as an `Int` will
be rejected with a 400, and the second endpoint will not be tried. This accords
with the behaviour of more traditional frameworks and, as Edsko de Vries showed
in a [blog post](http://www.edsko.net/temp/dependently-typed-servers/), no loss
of expressivity is entailed by the change.

We expect this to enable streaming combinators.

## Remove matrix params

Matrix params were interacting poorly with the rest of `servant`, because they
necessitate special behaviour. We decided to remove them. If you were relying
on them and would like to see them back, please let us know.

## Switch from `EitherT` to `ExceptT`

Along with the rest of the world, we've moved to `ExceptT`, which is in `mtl`.
Updating should consist of just replacing all occurrences of `EitherT` with
`ExceptT`.

## `Manager` and `BaseUrl` as an argument

Previously the *http-client* manager was created (with `unsafePerformIO`) by
the *servant-client* library itself. This meant that it was impossible to
configure the `Manager`. Now the `Manager` is passed in as an argument to
client:

``` haskell
-- Old code
endpoint1 :<|> endpoint2 = client api
-- endpoint1 :: BaseUrl -> X
-- New code
endpoint1 :<|> endpoint2 = client api baseUrl manager
-- endpoint1 :: X
```

We're not entirely happy with this solution, since sometimes you want the
`endpoint1` functions to take these two arguments instead (for example, if you
would like to distribute client functions as a library). But it is an
improvement.

## `NoContent` and status codes

Previously we were much too smart about HTTP status codes. In particular, when
the type of the response was `()`, we would return 204 (No Content). This was
sometimes convenient, but generally more trouble than it was worth - some
people wanted 200 codes anyhow, some people pointed out that 205 was also often
a sensible response, and moreover, `()` was too generally-used a type to
convey the appropriate semantics. We now have a dedicated `NoContent` type for
that, and the status code is up to you to decide (by default it will continue
to be 200).

*NOTE*: additionally, and for many of the same reasons, `Post` now returns an
HTTP 200 on success (rather than 201). Use `PostCreated` if you would like the
old behaviour.

## servant-js

The javascript codegen story has been considerably improved. Not only is there
`jquery`-based codegen, but also `Angular`, [`Axios`](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)
and vanilla (xhr-based) codegen. freezeboy wrote a separate post going into
more detaisla about how all of it works.

## servant-foreign

With the proliferation of servant codegen packages, Denis Redozubov factored
out much of the common logic into a `servant-foreign` package. This should make
it easier to write yet more codegen packages.

## Auth

One of the most drawn out discussions and PRs in `servant` has been Auth. Aaron
Levin was patient enough to work through several ideas as all of us explored
the design space. We currently have two auth combinators: a `BasicAuth`
combinator, and a still somewhat experimental but more general `AuthProtect`
combinator.

### Basic Auth

(*NOTE*: Basic Auth sends text in the clear, so only use this over HTTPS!)

An API protected by Basic Auth in `servant` looks like this:

``` haskell
data User = ...
type API = BasicAuth "my-realm" User :> PrivateAPI
```
Where `User` is an application-specific datatype that your handlers will
receive as an argument in case authentication succeeds.

`servant` needs to know how to generate a `User` from a username and password
string. For that, we use the new `Context` mechanism.

``` haskell
serverContext :: Context (BasicAuthCheck User ': '[])
serverContext = authCheck :. EmptyContext

authCheck :: BasicAuthCheck User
authCheck =
  let check (BasicAuthData username password) =
        if username == "servant" && password == "server"
        then return (Authorized (User "servant"))
        else return Unauthorized
  in BasicAuthCheck check
```
See the tutorial for more information.

# Conclusion

SÃ¶nke Hahn has also done a lot of work improving our tutorial and
documentation. We have moved to *Read the Docs*, which makes it easy to
documentation for multiple versions of the package. We have also moved towards
literate Haskell, which has already improved the quality of the documentation.
