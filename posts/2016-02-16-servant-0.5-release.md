Quite a lot of exciting changes have happened in since the last major release.
The breaking changes are:

 - Trie-based routing (Andres)
 - Proper error handling (Andres)
 - Config machinery (Sönke/Julian)
 - http-api-data (Nickolay)
 - Unifying method combinators (Julian)
 - Non-memoized request body (Julian)
 - Remove matrix params (Julian)
 - Switch from EitherT to ExceptT
 - NoContent rather than ()

# Unifying method combinators

Previously each of 'Get', 'Put', 'Post', etc. were entirely separate datatypes.
This also meant each interpretation needed to included instances for all of
them. The 0.5 release makes them instead type-synonyms:

  type Get TODO

This makes it easy to change the status code of a success response. To further
facilitate that, we now provide a variety of other type synonyms for responses
other than 200.

# Non-memoized request body

Prior to Andres Löh's trie-based routing improvements, we had to keep the
request body in memory for more-or-less the duration of the request-response
cycle. This was of course far from ideal, but necessary given that we could not
tell whether the request might be re-routed to a different endpoint. After the
changes, we can now remove it. Note however that certain idioms, such as

  type API = ReqBody '[JSON] Int :> Get '[JSON] Int
        :<|> ReqBody '[JSON] String :> Get '[JSON] String

No longer make sense - a request body that cannot be decoded as an `Int` will
be rejected with a 400, and the second endpoint will not be tried. This accords
with the behaviour of more traditional frameworks and, as Edsko de Vries showed
in a [blog post](http://www.edsko.net/temp/dependently-typed-servers/), no loss
of expressivity is entailed by the change.

# Remove matrix params

Matrix params were interacting poorly with the rest of `servant`, because they
necessitate special behaviour. We decided to remove them. If you were relying
on them and would like to see them back, please let us know.

# Switch from EitherT to ExceptT

Along with the rest of the world, we've moved to `ExceptT`, which is in `base`.
Updating should consist of just replacing all occurrences of `EitherT` with
`ExceptT`.
